name: Feature request
about: Suggest an idea for this project

---

The ideal feature request comes with code via a pull request - after you have discussed the idea and approach with the developers via the mailing lists. This (or commercial support) is the most probable way to get a feature into IXP Manager! Feel free to file feature requests as an issue and tag it as such.

We will give all feature requests a fair hearing and due consideration. But, those that we are unlikely to implement pro bono or those that do not align with the core purpose of IXP Manager may be closed or moved to a feature request file so as not to clog up the issue tracker.
