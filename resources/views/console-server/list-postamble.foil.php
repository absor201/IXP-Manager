    <h3>Console Servers</h3>

    <p>
        An IXP would typically have out of band access to critical infrastructure devices by means of a
        console server. This page allows you to add / edit / delete / list console server devices and, for
        any such device, record what console server port is connected to what device (as well as connection
        characteristics such as baud rate).
